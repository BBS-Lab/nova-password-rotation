# Changelog

All notable changes to `bbs-lab/nova-password-rotation` will be documented in this file.

## v1.0.0 — Initial release - 2026-07-20

First stable release of **Nova Password Rotation** — force any authenticatable implementing `MustRotatePassword` to rotate its password every N days. When the password expires, a [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) middleware redirects the logged-in user to a native, Nova-styled change-password screen. Light, secure, and works almost out of the box on **Nova 4 and Nova 5**.

### ✨ Features

- **Interface-driven** — `MustRotatePassword` interface + `RotatesPassword` trait on any authenticatable (not tied to `User`); auto-stamps the timestamp on every password change
- **Forced rotation** — configurable period (`days`); expired users are redirected to a native, Nova-styled change screen
- **Auto-registered middleware** — `EnsurePasswordIsNotExpired` wired into Nova for you, robust across Nova 4 (inline `config('nova.middleware')`) and Nova 5 (the `nova` router group), gated by config and de-duplicated
- **Reuse prevention** — polymorphic password history rejects the last N passwords (reusable `PasswordNotReused` rule)
- **First-login enforcement** — a `null` timestamp counts as expired, so admin-provisioned accounts must set their own password
- **Expiry warning** — best-effort Nova notification within a configurable window, at most once per day
- **Tooling** — `password-rotation:report` Artisan command and a `PasswordRotated` event
- **i18n & config** — English & French translations, publishable; every setting is environment-driven

### ✅ Quality

- **100% line coverage**, mutation tested (**MSI 89%**), PHPStan level 8, Pint
- Verified in CI on **Nova 5** (Laravel 11/12/13, PHP 8.4/8.5) and **Nova 4** (Laravel 11, PHP 8.4)

### 📦 Requirements

PHP `^8.4` · Laravel Nova `^4.0 || ^5.0` · Laravel `^11.0 || ^12.0 || ^13.0`

> Nova 4 (through its Inertia dependency) tops out at PHP 8.4 and Laravel 11; on PHP 8.5 or Laravel 12+, use Nova 5.
